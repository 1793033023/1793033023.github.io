# Creating a TiDB Cluster for Testing Purposes

### Overview
+ In these exercises, you create a TiDB cluster using either the TiDB Playground cluster on your laptop or the TiDB Cloud Serverless Tier. 
+ Both cluster types are designed for testing purposes and are helpful in enabling developers to better understand the TiDB interfaces at no additional cost.

### Notes
+ Some of the steps require that you type commands in two different terminal windows. You might find it convenient to launch two terminals and keep them open for the duration of the exercises.
+ Your environment may be different with these exercises, including but not limited to `IP`, `port`, `username`, `password` and `directory`.
+ The "`$`" in your terminal window is an OS prompt.
+ The "`tidb>`" or "`mysql>`" in your terminal window is SQL command prompt. 
+ These exercises can be run on a single machine, such as your laptop.
+ These exercises are designed for TiDB Playground cluster and TiDB Cloud Serverless Tier. It is crucial to note that the TiDB Playground cluster is not designed for production purposes.
